# The Rock Shop (Mineral Exchange 3.0)

## About the project
I took only this as a little project to help me learn the MERN stack in the holidays (Which leaked slightly into my third semester at Coder Academy(MELB). <br>
It wasn't easy, but it was rewarding to get a better understanding of the stack and what it can do, as well as a further understanding of packages/other resources such as Semantic-Ui, Stripe, Mongo ATLAS as well as the benefits of using NextJS to handle the routing, as well as the shortfalls. <br>
Although the webpage is hosted now, I have continued to run into issues that I don't run into locally, I hope with more experience within the stack I'll continue to be able to develop and improve. <br>
I think I achieved the purpose of creating this, and it's cool to stand back and see the differences between how this functions verse my [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/ChristopherDalziel/mineral-exchange-2.0) application.
